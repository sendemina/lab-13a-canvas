	—Each shape you create draws on top of all of your previous drawwings.
	—In this case, the green circle is drawn over the black square:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

	<title>Five</title>
</head>
<body onload="draw()">
	<!-- https://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Wilson-MTEC1003/labs/12/canvas.html#5.0
		We’ll have to let the page know that it should start drawing once the entire page is loaded.
			—we do this by adding an onload event handler to the body tag...
			—that calls a function called draw() that we’ll define later
			—note that there are better ways to do this, but we’ll go with this technique for now.

	<canvas id="sketch" width="300" height="300">

			Let’s add a place to draw!. Use a pair of opening and closing tags called canvas… with attributes, id, width, and height.
			—id will be used later in order to reference this particular canvas
			—width and height are the dimensions of your drawing area
			—place this tag before your JavaScript (for now… we’ll see a more correct way of doing it later)
			—make sure to add an id attribute!
